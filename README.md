# lime labs remote reflow controller
A simple, Python 3 based remote toaster/hot-plate/reflow oven controller. Works over the network with smart power plugs (like TP-Link's HS100/110, others) and remote thermocouples (like our [lime labs wifi thermocouple](https://github.com/lime-labs/lime-labs-wifi-thermocouple)). No need to ever touch or fiddle with mains power!

Currently supports TP-Link smart plugs (HS100, HS110, others) and our Arduino based [lime labs wifi thermocouple](https://github.com/lime-labs/lime-labs-wifi-thermocouple).

Simple, cheap, safe.

Happy reflowing!
